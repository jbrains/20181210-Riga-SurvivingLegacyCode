# Testing

We can generate golden master output by running `ca.jbrains.trivia.test.GenerateGoldenMaster`, however, **please note** that this output is only repeatable when running on a **single machine architecture**. If you run the same code on Windows and Mac OS, then you'll get different golden master output. The current golden master output was generated on Linux, specifically Pop!_OS 18.04, which is a variant of Ubuntu.
